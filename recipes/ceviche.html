    <p>
        A delicious mexican seafood salad made from only the freshest fish and produce. 
        No cooking necessary as the acids from the lime juice will do all the work.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1 pound fresh, skinless snapper, bass, halibut, or other 
                ocean fish fillets, cut into 1/2-inch dice
            </li>
            <li>
                1 1/2 cups fresh lime juice
            </li>
            <li>
                1 medium white onion, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces
            </li>
            <li>
                2 medium-large tomatoes (about 1 pound), chopped into 1/2-inch
                 pieces
            </li>
            <li>
                Fresh hot green chiles (2 to 3 serranos or 1 to 2 jalape√±os), 
                stemmed, seeded and finely chopped
            </li>
            <li>
                1/3 cup chopped cilantro, plus a few leaves for garnish
            </li>
            <li>
                1/3 cup chopped pitted green olives (manzanillos for a typical
                 Mexican flavor)
            </li>
            <li>
                1 to 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil (optional)
            </li>
            <li>
                Salt
            </li>
            <li>
                3 tablespoons fresh orange juice or 1/2 teaspoon sugar
            </li>
            <li>
                1 large or 2 small ripe avocados, peeled, pitted and diced
            </li>
            <li>
                Tostadas, tortilla chips or saltine crackers, for serving
            </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a 1 1/2-quart glass or stainless steel bowl, combine the 
                fish, lime juice and onion. Use enough juice to cover the fish
                 and allow it to float freely; too little juice means unevenly 
                 "cooked" fish. Cover and refrigerate for about 4 hours, until 
                 a cube of fish no longer looks raw when broken open. Drain in 
                 a colander.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, mix together the tomatoes, green chiles, 
                cilantro, olives and optional olive oil. Stir in the fish and 
                season with salt, usually about 1/2 teaspoon. Add the orange 
                juice or sugar. Cover and refrigerate if not serving immediately. 
                Just before serving, gently stir in the diced avocado.
